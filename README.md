## Content
- Basically this was my startup idea when i was the first year student at Haaga Helia. The idea was building a job network to create connections between employers and employees and the target users are foreign people, who are living in Finland, but don't have Finnish language skill. But my school work and family's issues took a lot of time from me, so i had to abandon this project. <br>
